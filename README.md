Project Title: Ulventech word counter.

Project description: This application can get any paragraph from the user (in this case from an API) and show the top 10 used words in that paragraph in a beautiful table. This application is built with the help of Angular and AntDesign. The choice of AntDesign was because the library provides a lot of customizable and pre-made components which suited the prophecy of the application as well as the develepr's sense of design. RxJs has been a huge part of this application to make it easier to compose asynchronous or callback-based code. There has not been a real challenge for me to develop this project as it is not a complex one but I have learned a lot about unit testing in Angular. 

How to run:

#1 Clone the project 
#2 Run "npm install" or "npm i"
#3 Run "ng serve" or "ng s"

Recommendation: It is suggested that you use the latest satable version of Node and angular/cli for better compatibility.
